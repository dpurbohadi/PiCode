**System Architecture**

The system integrates an LMS (Moodle), IoT devices, and an AI feedback module through a secure VPN connection.
The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the AI-supported live coding and IoT learning environment.

**Description**

Greenhouse IoT Devices
The system includes IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and light sensors) and actuators (e.g., servo-based irrigation systems) installed in a greenhouse. These devices collect environmental data and execute commands received from the LMS.

**TailScale VPN**
Provides a secure, encrypted network that connects all IoT devices with the LMS and servers through the internet. This ensures real-time communication and remote access while maintaining data privacy.

**Internet Layer**
Acts as the communication backbone, linking the LMS, IoT network, and AI feedback module. It enables data flow between studentsâ€™ activities in the LMS and physical IoT responses in the greenhouse.

**Moodle (LMS)**
Hosts the PiCode Lab live coding environment, where students can write and execute code directly from the browser. The LMS manages user sessions, logs, and integration with SCORM packages.

**Programming Tools**
Embedded within the LMS, these tools allow students to develop control scripts, run code, and observe feedback in real time. The module logs each interaction for later analysis.

**Data Logger Server**
Receives and stores sensor readings from IoT devices. It also forwards relevant data to the LMS and supports synchronization for monitoring and evaluation.

**OpenAI API (Feedback Module)**
Processes student-submitted code and provides automated feedback through GPT-based analysis. It acts as a virtual instructor that evaluates logic, syntax, and coding efficiency.

System Flow :

  - The student writes and runs code in the LMS-based editor.
  - The LMS sends the command to IoT devices via the VPN network.
  - Sensors collect data and actuators respond accordingly.
  - The data logger records all activity and sends updates to the LMS.
  - The OpenAI API provides AI-generated feedback to guide student learning.
